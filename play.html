            MUSIC MASTER: Do you wish to see our pieces?
            <br>     
            MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Yes.
            <br>
            MUSIC MASTER: I have already told you that this is a little attempt
            I have made to show the different passions that music can express.
            <br>
            MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Very good.
            <br>
            MUSIC MASTER: (To musicians) Here, come forward. (To Monsieur Jourdain) You must imagine that they are dressed as shepherds.
            <br>
            MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Why always as shepherds? You see nothing but that everywhere.
            MUSIC MASTER: Without doubt. You must have three voices--a tenor, a soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a theorbo, and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play the ritournelles.
            <br>
            MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.

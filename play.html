            <h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p> Do you wish to see our pieces? </p>   
            <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> 
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p> I have already told you that this is a little attempt
            I have made to show the different passions that music can express.</p>
            <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
            <p> Very good.</p>
            <h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
            <p>(To musicians)</p>
             <p>Here, come forward.</p>
            <p>(To Monsieur Jourdain)</p>
             <p>You must imagine that they are dressed as shepherds.</p>
            <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
             <p>Why always as shepherds? You see nothing but that everywhere.</p>
            <h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6> 
            <p>Without doubt. You must have three voices--a tenor, a soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a theorbo, and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play the ritournelles.</p>
            <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> 
            <p>You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.</p>

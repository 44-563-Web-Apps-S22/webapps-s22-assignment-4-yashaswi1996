            <h6 class="name MONSIEUR-JOURDAIN"> MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>

            <p class="speech">Without doubt. You must have three voices--a tenor, a soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a theorbo, and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play the ritournelles.</p>

            <p class="speech">You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.</p>
